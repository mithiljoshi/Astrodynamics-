Orbital Mechanics and Astrodynamics using Python
1. The Two Body Problem
<br>Assumption - All that exist in the universe is a small body orbiting a large body where the mass of smaller body is negligible.</br>
This produces the most fundamental equation in orbital mechanics. The equation of universal gravitation thus takes form as:-
<br><i> F = G* m1*m2/r<sup>2</sup>  = Î¼ * m2 / r<sup>2</sup></i></br>
