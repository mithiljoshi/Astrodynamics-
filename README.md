Orbital Mechanics and Astrodynamics using Python
1. The Two Body Problem
<br>Assumption - All that exist in the universe is a small body orbiting a large body where the mass of smaller body is negligible.</br>
This produces the most fundamental equation in orbital mechanics. The equation of universal gravitation thus takes form as:-
<br><i> F = G* m1*m2/r<sup>2</sup>  = Î¼ * m2 / r<sup>2</sup></i></br>

<p>SPICE( Spacecraft Planet Instrument C-matrix Events): SPICE is a NASA ancillary information system used to compute geometric information used in planning and analyzing science observations obtained from robotic spacecraft. It is also used in planning missions and conducting numerous engineering functions needed to carry out those missions.
